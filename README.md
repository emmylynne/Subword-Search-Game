# Subword-Search-Game
A quick and easy Python game I developed for my mom, upon her request. The game is simple: You can either be given a random word or choose your own word. Then you must think of as many subwords that can be made using the letters of that word and enter them. The game will then check what you came up with and give you all the other subwords you missed!
